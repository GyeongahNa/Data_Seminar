### Details

- Every time the ball hits the paddle seven times, the ball speeds up.<br>
- When the ball hits the left or right part of the paddle, it returns in the direction it came from.
  When the ball hits the middle part of the paddle, only the y-direction is reversed.<br>
- When the ball breaks all the bricks, it goes to the next level.<br>
- If the ball falls under the paddle, the number of lives is reduced(represented by star images),
  and if all three lives are lost, the game ends.<br>
- Player wins the game when passing through all levels of the game.
