### Details
- Every time the ball hits the paddle seven times, the ball speeds up.
- When the ball hits the left or right part of the paddle, it returns in the direction it came from.<br>
  When the ball hits the middle part of the paddle, only the y-direction is reversed.
- When the ball breaks all the bricks, it goes to the next level.
- If the ball falls under the paddle, the number of lives is reduced(represented by star images),<br>
  and if all three lives are lost, the game ends.
- Player wins the game when passing through all levels of the game.
